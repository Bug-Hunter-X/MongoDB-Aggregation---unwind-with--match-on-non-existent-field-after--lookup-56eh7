# MongoDB Aggregation: $unwind with $match on non-existent field after $lookup

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in MongoDB aggregation pipelines involving `$lookup`, `$unwind`, and `$match` when dealing with potentially missing fields after the join operation.  The issue manifests as an unexpected pipeline failure rather than a graceful handling of documents missing the specified field.  The error message can be misleading, making debugging difficult.

## Problem Description

The provided JavaScript code showcases the problem. When a field referenced in the `$match` stage (`relatedDocs.someField`) does not exist in some documents after the `$lookup` and `$unwind` operations, the entire aggregation fails instead of filtering out documents where the field is missing. 

## Solution

The solution involves adding an additional `$match` stage before the `$unwind` stage to filter out documents where the `foreignKey` field does not exist or the lookup returns an empty array. This ensures that `$unwind` only operates on documents with relevant data, preventing the error.  The improved code also uses explicit `$exists` checks for robustness.

## How to Reproduce

1. Set up a MongoDB database.
2. Create collections named 'collectionA' and 'collectionB' with appropriate data, ensuring that the 'foreignKey' and 'someField' fields may or may not be present in the related documents.
3. Run the original code (`bug.js`) to observe the unexpected error.
4. Run the improved code (`bugSolution.js`) to see the corrected behavior.
